## **Observations & Insights**  
1. **Cloud Computing for Deep Learning:**  
   - Discusses elasticity, scalability, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.  
2. **Convolution Operations:**  
   - Demonstrates how filters extract edge features using different strides and padding options.  
3. **Max & Average Pooling:**  
   - Compares max pooling (preserves key features) and average pooling (smoothens features).  
4. **AlexNet & ResNet Architectures:**  
   - **AlexNet:** Implements deep convolutional layers for image classification.  
   - **ResNet:** Uses residual blocks to maintain gradient flow in deep networks.
